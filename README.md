An AI-powered First Aid Guidance and Hospital Recommendation System that combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning (CNN)** to assist users with minor injuries and symptom-based guidance.

This system provides:
- 📝 Symptom-based classification using ML
- 🖼️ Image-based injury detection using CNN
- 🩹 Structured First Aid recommendations
- 🏥 Nearby hospital suggestions based on user location
- 🗺️ Google Maps integration for navigation

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ TF-IDF + Machine Learning symptom classifier  
- ✅ Custom CNN for minor injury image classification  
- ✅ Hybrid prediction logic (text + image)  
- ✅ Rule-based medical safety overrides  
- ✅ Hospital recommendation engine  
- ✅ Clean frontend interface  
- ✅ Modular backend architecture
